CMake Error at /home/yin-roc/1-Github/Ubuntu20.04-VMware/workspace/qt_ros_ws/demo02_ws/src/demo/CMakeLists.txt:46 (add_executable):
  Target "demo_node" links to target "Qt6::WebChannel" but the target was not
  found.  Perhaps a find_package() call is missing for an IMPORTED target, or
  an ALIAS target is missing?


CMake Generate step failed.  Build files cannot be regenerated correctly.
